    <h1>Chicken Shawerma Recipe</h1>

    <img src="../images/Chicken-Shawarma.jpg" alt="Chicken shawerma">
    
    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>This Middle Eastern chicken is incredibly aromatic.
        The marinade is very quick to prepare and the chicken can be frozen in the marinade,
        then defrosted prior to cooking. It is best cooked on the outdoor grill / BBQ, but I 
        usually make it on the stove. Serve with a simple salad and flatbread laid out on a large platter and 
        let your guests make their own wraps.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2lb /1 kg chicken thigh fillets , skinless and boneless</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>MARINADE</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 large garlic clove , minced (or 2 small cloves)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ground cardamon</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cayenne pepper (reduce to 1/2 tsp to make it not spicy)</li>
        <li>2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>Black peppe</li>
        <li>2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>YOGHURT SAUCE</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup Greek yoghurt</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
        <li>Squeeze of lemon juice</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>TO SERVE</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 flatbreads (Lebanese or pita bread orhomemade soft flatbreads)</li>
        <li>Sliced lettuce (cos or iceberg)</li>
        <li>Tomato slices</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the marinade ingredients in a large ziplock bag (or bowl).</li>
        <li>Add the chicken and use your hands to make sure each piece is coated. If using a ziplock bag, I find it convenient to close the bag then massage the bag to disperse the rub all over each chicken piece.</li>
        <li>Marinate overnight or up to 24 hours</li>
        <li>Combine the Yoghurt Sauce ingredients in a bowl and mix. Cover and put in the fridge until required (it will last for 3 days in the fridge).</li>
        <li>Heat grill/BBQ (or large heavy based pan on stove) on medium high. 
            You should not need to oil it because the marinade has oil in it and also thigh fillets have fat. 
            But if you are worried then oil your hotplate/grill. (See notes for baking)</li>
        <li>Place chicken on the grill and cook the first side for 4 to 5 minutes until nicely 
            charred, then turn and cook the other side for 3 to 4 minutes (the 2nd side takes less time).</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the grill and cover loosely with foil. Set aside to rest for 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>


    <h3>TO SERVE</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice chicken and pile onto platter alongside flatbreads, Salad and the Yoghurt Sauce.</li>
        <li>To make a wrap, get a piece of flatbread and smear with Yoghurt Sauce. Top with a bit of lettuce and tomato and Chicken Shawarma. Roll up and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
